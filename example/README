This directory contains files that will demonstrate HOMER using various 
samplers.  

Configuration files take the name format of 
    config_<sampler>.cfg

Note that the parameters differ between the MCMC-based (demc, snooker) and 
nested sampling-based (multinest, ultranest) configurations.
For details on each parameter of the configuration file, see the user manual.

The necessary input files are located in the appropriately named subdirectory, 
inputs.  Here is a description of each file:
data_case0_unc01.npy -- the data we are fitting.
datmax.npy -- NN training set maxima, for each input and output parameter
datmin.npy -- as above,  but  minima
filters/ -- directory holding the filter files.  Each define which channels of 
            the NN output correspond to a certain data point.
make_filters.py -- code used to produce the filters.
mcmc_func.py -- contains functions to be evaluated at each MCMC iteration
mean.npy -- Like the maxima/minima files, but the mean.
multinest_func.py -- input functions for the MultiNest sampler.
stdev.npy -- Like the maxima/minima/mean files, but the standard deviation.
ultranest_func.py -- input functions for the UltraNest sampler.
uncert_case0_unc01.npy -- the uncertainty on each data point.
xvals_binned46.npy -- xvals.npy, but at the resolution of the inference.  
                      See make_filters.py.
xvals.npy -- the X-axis values that correspond to each NN output.

To run a given config,
    path/to/HOMER.py config_<sampler>.cfg

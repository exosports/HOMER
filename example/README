Introduction
============

This directory holds an example of how to run HOMER. It matches the use case 
demonstrated in Himes et al. (2020).

NOTE: Executing this example requires files from the MARGE example!
      Run that first if you wish to run this example.

********************************** IMPORTANT **********************************
Requirements:
                   >= 1 core
                   >= 3.5 GB RAM available (recommended system RAM >= 6 GB)
                   >= 1 GB free space
Recommended:
                   GPU with >= 4 GB RAM

If using an operating system that is not Linux-based, some aspects of the 
example will likely need to be adjusted.  Users are encouraged to submit 
updates to this example guide via pull requests if they find modifications are 
necessary for certain operating systems.

Walkthrough
===========

This section will walk the user through executing the example.

Ensure that the repo's submodules have also been cloned.  
When cloning HOMER, this can be done by
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/exosports/HOMER HOMER/
  cd MARGE/
Alternatively, if HOMER has already been cloned, pull the submodules by 
navigating to the HOMER directory and 
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

Next, build MCcubed:
  make mccubed

Now, we are ready to begin.

Navigate to the directory where the example files are at.
  cd example
If the user has copied these files to another location outside of HOMER, 
navigate there instead.  The paths in some input files will need to be changed 
by the user. 

Execute HOMER:
  ../HOMER.py example.cfg

It will begin the retrieval, and should take < 1 hour.

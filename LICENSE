Helper Of My Eternal Retrievals (HOMER), a code to infer
properties of planetary atmospheres based on observed spectroscopic
information via a neural network surrogate model of radiative transfer.

This project was completed with the support of the NASA Fellowship Activity, 
grant 80NSSC20K0682, held by Principal Investigator Joseph Harrington in 
support of Michael Himes, the principal developer of HOMER.  
David C. Wright and Zacchaeus Scheffer  contributed to some aspects of the 
code, as described in the HOMER documentation.

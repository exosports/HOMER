Summary
=======
HOMER is a Bayesian inverse modeling code.  Given some data and 
uncertainties, the posterior distribution is determined for some model. 

HOMER uses the Large-selection Interface for Sampling Algorithms (LISA) for 
its Bayesian framework.  LISA allows for both MCMC and nested sampling 
algorithms.  For details, see the LISA User Manual at 
https://exosports.github.io/LISA/doc/LISA_User_Manual.html.

HOMER's forward model is a neural 
network (NN) surrogate model trained by MARGE.  For details on MARGE, see the 
MARGE User Manual at 
https://exosports.github.io/MARGE/doc/MARGE_User_Manual.html.

HOMER comes with complete documentation as well as a user manual to assist 
in its usage.  Users can find the latest HOMER User Manual at 
https://exosports.github.io/HOMER/doc/HOMER_User_Manual.html.

HOMER is an open-source project that welcomes improvements from the community 
to be submitted via pull requests on Github.  To be accepted, such improvements 
must be generally consistent with the existing coding style, and all changes 
must be updated in associated documentation.

HOMER is released under a Reproducible Research License.  Users are free to 
use the software for personal reasons.  Users publishing results from HOMER 
(or modified versions of it) in a peer-reviewed journal are required to publicly
release all necessary code/data to reproduce the published work.  Modified 
versions of HOMER are required to also be released open source under the same 
Reproducible Research License.  For more details, see the text of the license.

Installation
============
After recursively cloning the repo, users must compile one of LISA's modules. 
From HOMER's directory,
    make lisa

If the user wishes to compute median and 1-2-3sigma spectra, they will require 
the datasketches package.  From the HOMER directory, enter
    make datasketches
into the terminal.  Note that this package is NOT required to run HOMER.

To install both packages easily, do
    make all


Executing HOMER
===============
HOMER is controlled via a configuration file.  After setting up the 
HOMER configuration file, run HOMER via
    ./HOMER.py <path/to/configuration file>

Note that HOMER requires a trained MARGE model.  For details, see the MARGE 
User Manual (http://planets.ucf.edu/bart-docs/MARGE_user_manual.pdf).


Setting Up a HOMER Configuration File
=====================================
A HOMER configuration file contains many options, which are detailed in this 
section.  For an example, see config.cfg in the example subdirectory, and the 
associated README with instructions on execution.


Directories
-----------
inputdir  : str.  Directory containing HOMER inputs.
outputdir : str.  Directory containing HOMER outputs.


Run Parameters
--------------
quantiles   : bool. Determines whether to compute quantiles.
                    If the Datasketches library is not installed, this setting 
                    has no effect.
onlyplot    : bool. Determines whether to skip the inference.
                    Reproduces plots \& calculations related to posterior.
plot_PT     : bool. Determines whether to compute the explored 
                    pressure--temperature profiles using the formulation of 
                    Line et al. (2013).  Presently, this requires the model 
                    parameters to be ordered as 
                    log(kappa), log(gamma1), log(gamma2), alpha, beta, 
                    followed by any other parameters.
credregion  : bool. Determines whether to calculate the 68, 95, and 99\% 
                    credible regions \& uncertainties.

                    another.

                    Format: val1 val2 val3 val4 ...
                    E.g., compshift = 1 0 0 would increase all of the first 
                    parameter's values by 1 and leave the other parameters 
                    alone.

                    Separate each by indented newlines.
                    X-axis values must have the same type of units as `xvals`,
                    but may be separated by a constant multiplicative factor

                    spatial frequency (True) or wavelength (False).
                    More generally, when wn = False, the X-axis values are 
                    transformed to their inverse when plotting and

wnfact      : float. Multiplication factor when computing the inverse of 
                     `xvals`.

                     are um, then wnfact = 1e4.
filtconv    : float. Multiplication factor to convert the filter 
                     X-value units to the `xvals` units.
                     E.g., if filter X values are in nm, but `xvals` are in um, 
                     this argument would be set to 1e-3.

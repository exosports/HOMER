Summary
=======
HOMER is an MCMC-based inverse modeling code.  Given some data and 
uncertainties, the posterior distribution is determined for some model. 

At present, HOMER uses MCcubed for its MCMC.  HOMER's forward model is a neural 
network (NN) surrogate model trained by MARGE.  For details on MARGE, see the 
MARGE User Manual at http://planets.ucf.edu/bart-docs/MARGE_user_manual.pdf.

HOMER comes with complete documentation as well as a user manual to assist 
in its usage.  Users can find the HOMER User Manual at 
http://planets.ucf.edu/bart-docs/HOMER_user_manual.pdf.

HOMER is an open-source project that welcomes improvements from the community 
to be submitted via pull requests on Github.  To be accepted, such improvements 
must be generally consistent with the existing coding style, and all changes 
must be updated in associated documentation.

HOMER is released under a Reproducible Research License.  Users are free to 
use the software for personal reasons.  Users publishing results from HOMER 
or modified versions of it in a peer-reviewed journal are required to publicly 
release all necessary code/data to reproduce the published work.  Modified 
versions of HOMER are required to also be released open source under the same 
Reproducible Research License.  For more details, see the text of the license.

Installation
============
After recursively cloning the repo, users must compile MCcubed. 
Do so by entering
    make mccubed
into the terminal.

If the user wishes to compute median and 1-2-3sigma spectra, they will require 
the datasketches package.  From the HOMER directory, enter
    make datasketches
into the terminal.  Note that this package is NOT required to run HOMER.

To install both packages easily, do
    make all


Executing HOMER
===============
HOMER is controlled via a configuration file.  After setting up the 
HOMER configuration file, run HOMER via
    ./HOMER.py <path/to/configuration file>

Note that HOMER requires a trained MARGE model.  For details, see the MARGE 
User Manual (http://planets.ucf.edu/bart-docs/MARGE_user_manual.pdf).


Setting Up a HOMER Configuration File
=====================================
A HOMER configuration file contains many options, which are detailed in this 
section.  For an example, see config.cfg in the example subdirectory, and the 
associated README with instructions on execution.
